# Color-Scale-Generator
## Documentation
### What it does: 
This tool takes one or more hex colors, then generates a series of tints and shades labeled from 50 (lightest) to 950 (darkest). For each step, the base color is mixed with white or black in specific ratios, ensuring a consistent distribution.

### How to use it: 
Enter one or more valid hex colors (comma-separated) in the "Colors" input below, then click the Generate Scales button. Each color will produce a palette of 11 swatches. Click on any swatch to copy its hex code.

### Example: 
If you type #1C3564, you'll see that Primary-50 is #E8EBF0, Primary-100 is #D2D7E0, and so on, matching exactly the shades needed.
